        Allow me to introduce my amazing mom, an amazing woman who has a special place in my life! She is strong and tough and she is originally from Bangui, in the beautiful province of Ilocos Norte. Her birthday is January 27. 
        She works hard at the University of Baguio right now. Despite her height of five feet, the proud mother of three demonstrates that her heart is much larger than her body. 
        Numerous experiences along her life's path have molded her into the extraordinary person she is today. She studied radiologic technology in college,
        demonstrating her commitment to the medical field and serving others. Despite the setback to her RadTech studies, her passion for providing care brought her to Taiwan, where she worked as a caregiver, demonstrating resilience and strength. She gives these important life lessons—perseverance and compassion—to her family and those around her.
